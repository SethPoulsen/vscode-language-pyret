# Pyret

A Visual Studio Code extension giving support for the Pyret language (https://www.pyret.org/).

Ported from https://github.com/brownplt/atom-language-pyret.

# Features
Currently just syntax highlighting. In the future, it would be great to have linting, debugging, and all the other things that are cool to have in language extensions.

# How To
To install manually, clone into ~/.vscode/extensions. Also accessible through the  VS Code extension gallery soon.
